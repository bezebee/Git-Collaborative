# Git Collaborative Visual Steps for VS Code

[Slides here](https://app.box.com/s/r356kxmp3yiwa96evgmpera7il9t4xyg)

# Fork, Clone, and Sync Your Fork

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   - Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the repository page. This creates your own copy of this repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:

- **CodeAnywhere** - click on the **purple button**
- **Gitpod** - click on the **green button**
- **On VS Code** - **create folder** and then:
  - On your local machine, open a terminal.
  - Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
  - Clone your fork using the HTTPS URL:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/insert-your-username-here/Git-Collaborative.git
    ```
  - Add an upstream remote to your repository to track the original repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/bezebee/Git-Collaborative.git
    ```

# Make and Push Your Changes

3. **Create a New Branch:**

   - Create a new branch in your local repository to work on your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

4. **Add and Commit Changes:**

   - Make your code changes, add them, and commit them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

5. **Push Your Changes to Your Fork:**
   - Push your local branch with the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

# Create a Pull Request

6. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - After pushing your changes to your fork, follow link from the Terminal to create a pull request
   - Once PR created and merged, come back to the README to see what to do next

# Sync Your Fork with the Original Repository

7. **Fetch and Merge Upstream Changes:**

   - Fetch the latest changes from the original repository:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     ```
   - Merge the upstream changes into your local main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

8. **Update Your Fork on GitHub:**

- Push the merged changes to your fork on GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
